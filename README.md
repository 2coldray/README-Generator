## Description
The README.md Generator is a command-line application that takes in input from a user and uses it to make a README.md file. A README is necessary for every application to give information about the app to users and to other developers. This app makes making the file that much easier.

## Installation
1. Have node installed on computer.
2. Have this github repository installed.
3. Open terminal on text-editor, then run node index.js and answer the questions.

## Usage
This is how the command line should look after the user answers all the questions from the prompt. The G-README.md file will be created.

This is how the README should look after being generated.
